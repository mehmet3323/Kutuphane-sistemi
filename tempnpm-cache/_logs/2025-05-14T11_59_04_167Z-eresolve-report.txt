# npm resolution error report

While resolving: ProjeX@0.0.1
Found: @react-navigation/native@6.1.18
node_modules/@react-navigation/native
  @react-navigation/native@"^6.1.10" from the root project

Could not resolve dependency:
peer @react-navigation/native@"^7.1.9" from @react-navigation/stack@7.3.2
node_modules/@react-navigation/stack
  @react-navigation/stack@"*" from the root project

Fix the upstream dependency conflict, or retry
this command with --force or --legacy-peer-deps
to accept an incorrect (and potentially broken) dependency resolution.
